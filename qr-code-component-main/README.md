## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Google fonts


### What I learned

I recalled all the basics i've learned so far and i had put them to use. This was a very good refresher of HTML, CSS. I took my time to figure
out things and i tried to make it as similar as it looked in the challenge picture.


I stuggled with box-shadow a little and then i looked it up, this box-shadow is a generated one, although i and understand it.
```css
.card {
  box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 12px 28px 0px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 2px 4px 0px, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still struggling with minor alignments and CSS Grid. I tried inspecting my code as many times as i can and it helped me resolve the problem i was having 

### Useful resources

- [Box shadow generator](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me with box shadow which i could not wrap my head around. I really liked the box shadow styles and will use it going forward.
- [Making Image responsive](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-an-image-in-css/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally how to make image responsive inside a card. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
